        <p>Last summer I studied abroad in <strong> Porto, Portugal</strong> and it was <i>amazing</i>. The reason why I decided to go to Portugual was because I wanted to expand my Portuguese speaking abilities. My two choices was studying abroad either in Brazil or Portugual, but Portugal was my first choice because here at UGA, we only learn Brazilian Portuguese and I was really curious to learn more about European culture. When I arrived to Porto the first night, it was extremely overwhelming because I experienced culture shock. Even though I spoke intermediate level Portuguese, I felt intimidated by Portuguese native speakers and by other foreign students who spoke better than me. I also felt sad because I missed my family and I was the only UGA student at the University of Porto. Not only, was I the only UGA student there, but I was also the only American student in my classroom. Even though at first I felt pretty overwhelmed, the next few days got better. I realized that the culture shoch is a normal thing in with any person visiting a new foreign country. I realized that the best thing to do was to approach this study abroad experience with an open mind, meaning that I would give myself the oppportunity to learn more about the people, the language, the food, values and customs. Ultimately, my stay was incredible, I learned so much within such a short period of time. Now I'm taking this opportunity to share a little bit about my experience abroad, and I want to encourage students to take the opportunity to explore more what education abroad can offer! </p>
